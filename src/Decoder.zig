//! RFC 7541 section 6: decoding a header block into header fields.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! `iterate` returns an iterator rather than filling an array, because the two
//! consumers want different things from a block: a proxy collects every field
//! before routing, and a load generator counts them and throws them away. An
//! iterator lets the second one cost nothing, and lets either stop early on a
//! field it already knows is fatal.
//!
//! Fields borrow, and from three places:
//!
//!   - the comptime static table, which outlives everything;
//!   - the header block itself, for literals that were not Huffman-coded,
//!     which costs no output buffer at all and no copy;
//!   - the caller's output buffer, for Huffman-coded literals, which have to
//!     be decoded somewhere, and for anything read out of the dynamic table.
//!
//! That last one is a lifetime rule, not an optimization. A later field in the
//! same block can insert an entry, evict the one an earlier field came from,
//! and overwrite its bytes — so a slice into the dynamic table is valid only
//! until the next representation, which is shorter than the caller needs it.
//! Every read of the dynamic table copies out. `DynamicTable.insert` asserts
//! the other half of the same rule, and `iterate` asserts the third: that the
//! output buffer and the table arena are not the same memory.
//!
//! ## What bounds what
//!
//! The output buffer is the structural bound: a compression bomb expands into
//! a buffer the caller sized, and stops there. `list_size_max` is the protocol
//! bound the peer was told about (`SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE`), checked as
//! the block decodes rather than after, because a decoder that finishes the
//! work and then reports the overflow has already done what the attacker
//! wanted.
//!
//! There is deliberately no separate field-count bound. Every field costs at
//! least `Field.overhead` against `list_size_max`, so a count bound follows
//! from the size bound and cannot drift out of step with it. That is what
//! CVE-2026-49975 was: implementations had the size bound, counted cookie
//! crumbs as one field rather than many, and found that a byte of wire could
//! buy thousands of allocations. Accounting for every field, always, makes the
//! second bound unnecessary rather than forgotten. See `fieldsMax`.
//!
//! ## Non-minimal integers are accepted
//!
//! RFC 7541 section 5.1 does not require an integer to spend the fewest
//! continuation octets that can express it, so `{0x1f, 0x80, 0x00}` and
//! `{0x1f, 0x00}` are both the value 31 behind a 5-bit prefix. This decoder
//! accepts both. Rejecting the long spelling would be stricter than the RFC and
//! would break a conforming peer, and unlike the HTTP/1 framing ambiguities
//! that motivate strictness elsewhere, both spellings decode to the *same
//! value* — there is no second interpretation for two peers to disagree about,
//! only wasted octets, and `integer.continuation_octets_max` already bounds how
//! many of those a peer may spend.
