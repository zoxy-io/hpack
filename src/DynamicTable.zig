//! RFC 7541 section 2.3.2: the dynamic table, as caller-owned storage.
//!
//! ## Why the storage is the caller's
//!
//! A dynamic table is connection-lifetime, per-direction state — 4 KiB each way
//! at the default `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE`. That is the opposite shape from
//! everything else a proxy pools, which is sized for concurrent *activity*, so
//! where it comes from is a decision only the consumer can make. This type
//! takes two slices and never asks for more.
//!
//! It also makes a table of capacity zero an ordinary configuration rather than
//! a degenerate one: empty slices, no storage, and every insert immediately
//! evicts itself per section 4.4. A decoder advertising
//! `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE = 0` forbids the peer from indexing at all,
//! which deletes this half of the decoder's work — a lever worth being able to
//! pull without a code path of its own.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! Bytes live in one arena and entries in one ring. Insertion and eviction are
//! both FIFO — newest in at one end, oldest out at the other — so the live
//! bytes are always a single contiguous span, and an entry is never split.
//!
//! When an insert would run past the end of the arena, the live span is
//! compacted back to offset zero and the entry offsets are rebased. The
//! alternative, letting entries wrap, would mean a name arriving in two pieces
//! and every reader having to care; it would also need the arena to be twice
//! the capacity to stay contiguous on read, and the capacity is the number a
//! consumer writes its memory budget in.
//!
//! Compaction is amortized but not free, and the constant is worth stating
//! honestly rather than as "about one". A compaction moves the live span, `L`
//! octets, and leaves the write cursor at `L` — so the next one cannot happen
//! until another `C - L` octets have been inserted, where `C` is the arena.
//! That is `L / (C - L)` octets moved per octet stored, and `L` is a peer's
//! choice: it picks the header sizes.
//!
//! At the 4 KiB default the worst shape a peer can pick is entries of roughly
//! 260 octets, giving 13 live entries, 3380 live octets, and one compaction
//! every two inserts — about 6.5x. At `capacity_max` it is worse: entries of
//! roughly 1600 octets give 40 live and a compaction on *every* insert, moving
//! 64000 octets to store 1600, about 40x.
//!
//! Both are constant factors, so the amortization holds and the work stays
//! O(1) per insert. It is memory bandwidth rather than an unbounded loop. But
//! it is the reason a consumer sizes this table for its traffic instead of
//! handing over `capacity_max` because it can.
//!
//! ## Lifetime
//!
//! `get` returns slices into the arena, valid only until the next insert or
//! capacity change — a later field in the same header block can evict the entry
//! and overwrite its bytes. Callers that outlive one operation copy. `Decoder`
//! does, and says why.
