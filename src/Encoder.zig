//! RFC 7541 section 6: encoding header fields into a header block.
//!
//! ## Two modes, because the consumers want different things
//!
//! A proxy encodes a different response on every stream and wants the dynamic
//! table working for it. A load generator builds one request at startup and
//! sends it forever, and wants a block it can memcpy onto every stream of every
//! connection.
//!
//! That second one is not an optimization of the first: replaying bytes is only
//! *legal* if they never depended on a dynamic table, because the peer's
//! decoder table evolves and the same octets would resolve differently on the
//! second stream. `.static_only` is a guarantee about what the encoder touched,
//! enforced by `insert` asserting its mode rather than by anyone remembering.
//!
//! ## A short block is not an error
//!
//! `encode` fills what it can and reports how many fields it got through. It
//! cannot fail, and that is a correctness property rather than a convenience.
//!
//! An encoder that inserted into its table and then reported failure would have
//! moved state its peer never saw: the block is discarded, the peer's table
//! stays where it was, and the next block references an entry that does not
//! exist there. That is a connection error manufactured by the encoder — and it
//! is invisible locally, because everything the encoder can see is consistent.
//!
//! Stopping instead of failing makes it impossible: every field that entered
//! the table was also written to the target, so whatever the caller sends keeps
//! the two tables in step. The remainder continues in the next buffer, which is
//! what CONTINUATION frames are for (RFC 9113 section 6.10). A caller that
//! needs the whole list in one buffer compares `fields` against what it passed;
//! a `fields` of zero means the first field cannot fit a buffer of this size at
//! all, and no larger number of retries will help.
//!
//! ## Capacity has to match what the peer advertised
//!
//! The table starts at the capacity of the arena it is given, and no size
//! update is emitted for it. The peer's decoder starts at *its*
//! `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE`, so the two agree only if the consumer makes
//! them agree.
//!
//! An arena **smaller** than the peer's value is safe: this encoder evicts
//! sooner, its live entries stay a prefix of the peer's in the same order, and
//! every index it emits still resolves to the same field. An arena **larger**
//! is corruption, and the quiet kind — it indexes entries the peer has already
//! evicted, and the failure surfaces as a decode error on a later block. This
//! package cannot check it, because only the consumer sees the SETTINGS frame.
//! Size the arena at or below `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE`, or call
//! `encodeSizeUpdate` to move the peer first.
//!
//! ## Where the time goes
//!
//! Huffman coding is not the cost centre here; lookup is. The static table is a
//! comptime `StaticStringMap` from name to the run of entries sharing it —
//! RFC 7541 keeps same-named entries adjacent, so a name hit gives a short
//! contiguous range to compare values against, and `:status`'s seven is the
//! longest run there is. One probe answers both questions.
//!
//! The dynamic table is searched through two arrays of hashes kept parallel to
//! its entry ring. Whether an explicit `@Vector` scan earns its complexity is
//! still open: at 4 KiB there are at most 128 hashes, 512 octets, and the
//! benchmark workload keeps tables of three or four entries, so it does not
//! exercise a full one. That measurement needs a workload built for it.
//!
//! ## Indexing policy
//!
//! Every field that is not `never_indexed` is inserted, which is what the RFC's
//! own examples do and what makes them an exact-output gate rather than merely
//! a round-trip one. A consumer that wants a different policy — not indexing a
//! request identifier that will never repeat, say — sets `never_indexed`, which
//! is also the representation that keeps it out of an intermediary's table.
