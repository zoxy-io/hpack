//! One header field: a name and a value, both borrowed.
//!
//! This is the type the decoder emits and the encoder consumes, and it is
//! deliberately the smallest thing that can be one: two slices and a bit. The
//! package's whole reason to exist is that its two consumers do not share a
//! runtime, so it cannot name either one's header type — but a consumer can
//! build its own from this by construction rather than by copying, which is
//! what keeps a proxy's phase model intact across the boundary.
//!
//! ## Where the bytes live
//!
//! The slices borrow, and what they borrow from decides how long they are good
//! for. The decoder points them at either the comptime static table (good
//! forever) or the caller's own output buffer (good until the caller reuses
//! it). They are never pointed into the dynamic table: a later field in the
//! same header block can evict the entry a slice came from and overwrite its
//! bytes, so an indexed reference is copied out instead. That is a lifetime
//! rule, not an optimization, and `Decoder` states it again where it is
//! enforced.
