//! RFC 7541 section 5.2 and Appendix B: the fixed Huffman code.
//!
//! ## Decoding
//!
//! `decode` reads twelve bits per lookup and emits up to two symbols — two
//! because two five-bit codes fit in twelve bits and three do not. Four of the
//! 4096 patterns begin a code longer than the window and escape to a canonical
//! decode by length.
//!
//! Twelve is chosen against the code's own length distribution rather than by
//! taste; the table below `window_bits` records the measurement. The table is
//! 16 KiB, small enough to stay resident beside the rest of a proxy's working
//! set, which is the property that decides this design rather than raw
//! throughput. LiteSpeed's sixteen-bit window reads fewer lookups per octet and
//! measures faster in a tight loop, but it is 256 KiB and an L2 resident, and
//! this code runs on a thread also serving thousands of connections.
//!
//! `decodeReference` is the nibble automaton of Pajarola's "Fast Prefix Code
//! Processing" (2003), the construction nghttp2 has used since 2014. It was
//! `decode` until the window was measured against it, and it is kept because
//! the case for shipping the faster one rests on their agreeing everywhere —
//! same octets, same errors, same accept and reject. A consumer that never
//! calls it does not pay for its table: a binary calling only `decode` is
//! 16352 octets smaller, which is exactly the automaton's table.
//!
//! Validity comes free with the same lookups in both. Walking into the EOS leaf
//! is a decoding error rather than a terminator, and the padding rules of
//! section 5.2 — fewer than eight bits, all ones — are checked once at the end.
//!
//! ## Encoding
//!
//! One code per input octet, accumulated in a 64-bit register and flushed a
//! byte at a time. A two-octet table (65536 entries, 512 KiB) buys 1.7-2.1x,
//! and costs more cache than this package is willing to spend for it.
